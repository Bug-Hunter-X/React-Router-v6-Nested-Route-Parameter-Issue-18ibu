In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when nested routes are not rendering correctly, especially when using the `useParams` hook.  The problem often manifests as undefined or incorrect parameter values being passed down to nested components. This is frequently due to a mismatch between the route path structure and how `useParams` is accessed.

**Example of buggy code:**
```javascript
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function ParentRoute() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ChildRoute />
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildRoute() {
  let { id } = useParams();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Child Route: {id}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

// Route definition (in App.js or similar):
<Routes>
  <Route path="/parent/:id" element={<ParentRoute />}>
    <Route path=":id" element={<ChildRoute />} />
  </Route>
</Routes>
```
This will not work as expected because the nested route path ":id" is overriding the parent's route parameter.
